# Love2D game template!

[Love2D](https://love2d.org) is a simple and easy to use video game creation framework written in C with scripting done in Lua!

This template aims to help setup projects faster.

>[!NOTE]
>This template is mainly for personal use; <br/>
>But anyone can use it!

# Files
- main.lua -> This is where your main game logic goes!
- conf.lua -> Window config (see the comment)
- scripts -> This is where every script for your game should go.
- lib -> This is where external libraries should go (eg. cartographer.lua)
- assets -> Where sprites, fonts, level data go.

<br/> 

- .editorconfig -> If you have the `Editor Config` extension enabled, you are able to control your code style! (Eg. using tabs instead of spaces, space width, etc.)

<br/>

- .gitignore -> Where all ignored files should go. (They won't be added to the git repository)
- .gitattributes -> Git attributes; They ignore the `lib` folder from being counted in the language counter on github!

<br/>

- .vscode -> This directory does a little bit of setup, if you use the Lua and Love2D extensions, you will get a working LSP system with autocomplete and error highlighting!
